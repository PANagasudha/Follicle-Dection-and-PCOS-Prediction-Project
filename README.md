# Follicle-Dection-and-PCOS-Prediction-Project
This project uses deep learning to detect ovarian follicles in ultrasound images using YOLO and predict PCOS using a CNN model. Follicles are first detected and cropped, then classified as PCOS or Non-PCOS based on their features. This helps in fast and accurate diagnosis of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome.
